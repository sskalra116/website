		<p class="science">Mindfulness scales</p>
		<p>In the relatively new field of western psychological mindfulness,
		researchers attempt to define and measure the results of mindfulness
		primarily through controlled, randomised studies of mindfulness
		intervention on various dependent variables. The participants in mindfulness
		interventions measure many of the outcomes of such interventions subjectively.
		For this reason, several mindfulness inventories or scales (a set of questions 
		posed to a subject whose answers output the subject's aggregate answers in the
		form of a rating or category) have arisen. Twelve such methods are mentioned 
		by the Mindfulness Research Guide
		</p>
		<p class="science">Brain mechanisms</p>
		<p>In 2011, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health
		(NCCIH) released findings from a study in which magnetic resonance
		images were taken of the brains of 16 participants 2 weeks before and 
		after the participants joined the mindfulness meditation (MM) program by
		researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital, Bender Institute of Neuroimaging
		in Germany, and the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Researchers concluded that
		</p>
		<blockquote id="bQuote">..these findings may represent an underlying brain

		mechanism associated with mindfulness-based improvements in mental health.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		The analgesic effect of MM involves multiple brain mechanisms including
		the activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
		In addition, brief periods of MM training increases the amount of grey matter in the
		hippocampus and parietal lobe. Other neural changes resulting from MM may
		increase the efficiency of attentional control.
		Participation in MBSR programmes has been found to correlate with
		decreases in right basolateral amygdala gray matter density,
		and increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus.
		</p>
		<p class="science">Changes in the brain</p>
		<p>Mindfulness meditation also appears to bring about favourable structural changes
		in the brain. One recent study found a significant cortical thickness increase in 
		individuals who underwent a brief -8 weeks- MBSR training program and that this increase
		was coupled with a significant reduction of several psychological indices related
		to worry, state anxiety, depression. Another study describes how mindfulness based
		interventions target neurocognitive mechanisms of addiction at the attention-appraisal-emotion
		interface. A meta-analysis by Fox et al. (2014) using results from 21 brain imaging studies
		found consistent differences in the region of the prefronal cortex and other brain regions
		associated with body awareness. In terms of effect size the mean effect was rated as moderate.
		(Cohen's d = 0.46) However the results should be interpreted with caution because funnel
		plots indicate that publication bias is an issue in meditation research. 
		A follow up by Fox et al. (2016) using 78 functional neuro-imaging studies suggests
		that different meditation styles are reliably associated with different brain activity.
		Activations in some brain regions are usually accompanied by deactivation in others.
		This finding suggests that meditation research must put emphasis on comparing practices
		from the same style of meditation, for example results from studies investigating focused
		attention methods cannot be compared to results from open monitoring approaches.
		</p>
		<p>A 6-week mindfulness based intervention was found to correlate 
		with a significant gray matter increase within the precuneus.
		Interestingly a positive relationship has been found between the volume of
		gray matter in the right precuneus and the subject's subjective happiness score.
