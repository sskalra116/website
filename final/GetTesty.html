	<h1>Get Testy</h1>
	<h3>Validation</h3>
	<p>The css page validated right in the first go but the html page 
		gave many errors and warnings in the beginning,
		major of which were stray tags,img alt attributes,element cannot be descendent of 
		a particular element and warnings included putting header for 
		the section field and specifying the en(english) language in html tags.
		These all errors and warnings have been <q>fixed</q> now and both the html and 
		css pages validate.
	</p>
	<h3>Flexibility</h3>
	<p>Most of the pages have flexible content.Few of the issues that I have are with
		the navigation bar and main headings since they are absolutely positioned on the 
		relative background image so, resizing the page gave issues with these things.
		The images are fixed size so, on shortening the window,they go out of their sections.
		Most of the issues have been fixed but using auto margin property.
	</p>
	<h3>Speed</h3>
	<p>I tested the speed on https://gtmetrix.com/ page and here are the results-<br>
		<img src="../images/tested.PNG"><br>
		The images weren't optimized and weren't compressed so, the result,
		wasn't too good but the website recommended to use progressive jpegs to optimize time.
		Also,Before correcting the errors and warning, the time of execution was more but
		after correction, the execution time reduced significantly.
	</p>
	<h3>Accessibility</h3>
	<p>For the accessibility part, I tested my site on http://www.cynthiasays.com/.
		Few of the results that I got were-<
		<ul>
		<li>Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets.</li>
		<li> Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without col...</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Browser Independence</h3>
	<p>
		I tested my website on the following browsers-
		<ol>
			<li>Google Chrome</li>
			<li>Microsoft Explorer</li>
			<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
		</ol>
		Nearly all the results were same except for the list item in one of 
		the page where the list-style-type were presented well in chrome but were
		shifted towards left in edge and explorer.
