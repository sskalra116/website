		<p class="story" id="override">THE FREEDOM OF YOUR TRUE SELF: “Through meditation on a daily basis,
		I get to strip away the masks that we build – that I build for myself,
		small and large – to reach the feeling of my true self.
		‘Oh, this is who I really am! This is how I can experience life!’ 
		My guiding principle has become being true to myself.
		I used to have lots of rules… No more,”
		<br>
		-Hugh Jackman says.

		<h6>Yes, the answer!</h6>
		<p>Meditation is a practice where an individual trains the mind or induces a
		mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or for the mind to simply
		acknowledge its content without becoming identified with that content or as an end in itself.
		</p>

		<p>The term meditation refers to a broad variety of practices that includes techniques 
		designed to promote relaxation, build internal energy or life force and develop compassion,
		love, patience, generosity, and forgiveness. A particularly ambitious form of meditation aims
		at effortlessly sustained single-pointed concentration meant to enable its practitioner to
		enjoy an indestructible sense of well-being while engaging in any life activity.
